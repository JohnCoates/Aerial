## Aerial - Apple TV Aerial Views Screen Saver

Aerial is completely open source, so feel free to contribute to its development!

## Uninstallation

There are three options to uninstall Aerial from your Mac.

* Right-click on the Aerial screen saver in System Preferences and select `Delete "Aerial"`.
* Or delete the file(s) directly. macOS can store screen savers in two locations. `/Library/Screen Savers` and `/Users/YOURUSERNAME/Library/Screen Savers`. Check both locations for a file called "Aerial.saver" and delete any copies you find.
* If you installed Aerial using brew, then the following command in a Terminal window should remove the brew installed version. `brew cask uninstall aerial`

You may also want to delete the folder `/Users/YOURUSERNAME/Library/Caches/Aerial`. This is where Aerial stores the cached copies of the aerial videos.

## Features
* **Auto Load Latest Aerials:** Aerials are loaded directly from Apple, so you're never out of date.
* **Play Different Aerial On Each Display:** If you've got multiple monitors, this setting loads a different aerial for each of your displays.
* **Favorites:** You can choose to only have certain aerials play.
* **Preview:** Clicking on an aerial in the screen saver options previews that aerial for you.

## Compatibility
Aerial is written in Swift, which requires OS X Mavericks or above.

## Brew Cask Support - Install Remotely
If you're looking to install Aerial across many systems, remotely, or simply from terminal I recommend [Brew Cask](http://caskroom.io/).

Issue the following terminal command: `brew cask install aerial`

## Troubleshooting

- Black screen: If you are behind a firewall (like Little Snitch or Hands Off!) try creating exceptions for Aerial to allow it access to Apple's servers. Be sure the applications 'ScreenSaverEngine.app' and 'System Preferences.app' are not being blocked access to *.phobos.apple.com and *.phobos.apple.com.edgesuite.net. If that isn't an option and you are on a Macbook try caching the videos while connected to a different network.
- "You cannot use the Aerial screen saver with this version of macOS." error: Select Aerial, close System Preferences with Aerial still selected, re-open System Preferences and Aerial should now work. This is a known bug with Swift screensavers in macOS/OS X reported to Apple as [rdar://25569037](http://www.openradar.me/25569037).
