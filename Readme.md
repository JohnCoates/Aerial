Aerial is a Mac screensaver (macOS 10.12 or later) based on the new Apple TV screensaver that displays the Aerial movies Apple shot over New York, San Francisco, Hawaii, China, etc. Starting with version 2.0.0, it also includes videos shared by Joshua Michaels & Hal Bergman!

Aerial is completely open source, so feel free to contribute to its development.

This repository is used **solely** for development.

Starting with version 2.3.0, Aerial can now display current weather information *and* forecasts to your location, thanks to [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org).

## Multilingual Support

Aerial features overlay descriptions of the main geographical features displayed in the videos.

![Community Strings example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4295/52958947-75bd6180-3395-11e9-947f-3c77d9f41928.jpg)

Video descriptions are available in many languages (Spanish, French, Polish… [check the complete list here](Resources/Community/Readme.md)) and that is only possible thanks to the collaboration and interested work of many volunteers. To best serve the international community we've defined a translation workflow that allows any person, even with **no technical background** to help translate the descriptions.
